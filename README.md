# Homework of Data Structure and Algorithm

But DSA does not refer to Digital Signature Algorithm. LOL.

We have 4 homework in total, which are Linked List, Huffman Tree, Kruskal Algorithm and Quick Sort/Binary Search.

Okay, I am also very interesting why Quick Sort and Binary Search is the last project.

Busy nowadays, temporary implemented linked list, with C++.

## Singly Linked List

According to homework requirement, implemented an extremely strange merge function. I have no more interest in it.

Uploaded with my benchmark test source codes. I just found that benchmark should be easier if I use STL \<forward\_list\>.

## Huffman Tree and Huffman Encode

No benchmark test...

use a frequency array to construct Huffman tree. Only accept ASCII characters.
